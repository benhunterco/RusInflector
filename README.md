# RusInflector
Python that can decline and conjugate Russian words
Requires pymorphy2 library.
This can be installed with the command:
> pip install pymorphy2

run from terminal or I guess command prompt on windows.
pip should be installed by default with python3, but if not it needs to be installed as well.
